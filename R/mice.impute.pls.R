#' Imputation by partial least square regression
#'
#' Imputes univariate missing data by using partial least square regression.
#'
#' @aliases mice.impute.pls pls
#' @inheritParams mice.impute.norm.boot
#' @param nlvs The number of latent variables to consider in the PLS regression.
#' @return Vector with imputed data, same type as \code{y}, and of length
#' \code{sum(wy)}
#' @details
#' Imputation of \code{y} by PLS. The procedure is as follows:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item A bootstrap sample of the observed part of the data is taken
#' \item PLSR is estimated on this sample for a given number of latent variables (nlvs).
#' \item Based on this PLSR model, predictions on the new data x[!ry, ] are returned
#' \item Imputations are then obtained by adding noise to these predictions.
#' }
#' 
#' Noise is added by sampling from a standard normal distribution rescaled based 
#' on the residuals standard error of the PLSR.
#' The residual degrees of freedom (df) are computed based on Krylov representation 
#' described by Kramer and Sugiyama (2011).
